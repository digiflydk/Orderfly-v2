# Brand Website Module - QA Strategy

Each task under **Epic 511** will be accompanied by acceptance tests that target the API layer directly, bypassing the React UI.

*   **Examples:**
    *   Tests for saving and retrieving homepage content.
    *   Tests for creating, updating, and deleting a custom page.
    *   Tests for domain resolution logic (`resolveBrandByDomain`).
*   **Deployment Rule:** No deployment is permitted if acceptance tests for this module fail.
